<p>This is a simple siteswap visualization tool, which was inspired by <a href="https://juggling.graphics/">juggling.graphics</a>.
    Currently, it supports only asynchronous vanilla siteswaps, and performs no validation on the siteswaps entered before drawing the diagrams.
The purpose of this tool is to generate SVG representations of siteswaps. Hopefully the configuration options are self-explanitory. Some settings
apply to only one of the diagrams, some apply to both. All configuration settings relate to the diagrams only - they do not modify the siteswap. 
</p>
<p>Siteswaps can be modified by working in the SVG sections. Here are some of the actions you can perform:
    <li>To select a throw, click in the coresponding line. Since siteswaps repeat, this will highlight multiple (identical) lines.
        If too many lines are selected for your taste, try entering the siteswap several times in the input box. (e.g. If you enter 
        531, and select a 5 line, all 5 lines will be selected. But if you enter 531531, and select a 5 line, every other 5 line will be selected.)
    </li>
    <li>To un-select, click on the selected line again.</li>
    <li>To swap two throws, select one line, then select another.</li>
    <li>To add/subtract an object with a throw selected, press + or -. That throw will be incremented/decremented accordingly.</li>
    <li>To add/subtract an object with no throws selected, press + or -. All throws will be incremented/decremented accordingly.</li>
    <li>To cycle the starting point of the pattern, use the left and right arrow keys.</li>
    <li>To change a throw to something else, select the throw, then type the desired number. This throw will be replaced, and the pattern
        will be adjusted to make this fit. (Experimental)
    </li>
